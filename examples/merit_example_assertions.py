"""Demonstrates how to write assertions with Merit.

* Regular Python expressions work as expected and could be parsed by Merit CLI.
* Merit AI-powered assertions are provided as async functions.
    - They are grouped into three categories:
        - Facts assertions
        - Conditions assertions
        - Style assertions
    - They help to check for hallucinations, relevancy, instruction following, and style. 
* All Merit assertions have the same interface: 
    - `actual`: the actual data to check
    - `reference`: the reference to check against
    - `context`: optional context to provide additional information
    - `strict`: optional flag to disable strict evaluations
* Combine and configure assertions to align your current QA goals
